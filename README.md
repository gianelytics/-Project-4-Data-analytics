## 🎓 Project Objectives
- Organize and manipulate data using SQL
- Make business decisions based on data
- Visualize data in a Business Intelligence (BI) tool
- Organize and communicate findings

## 📌 Context
In this project, a reservations analysis will be conducted in a hotel business in the tourism industry to understand the cancellation rate of reservations and which reservations have the greatest risk of cancellation, so that the contract with the agency can be renegotiated. For this, five hypotheses will guide this part of the analysis:

> 1. Reservations made with greater anticipation have a high risk of cancellation.
> 2. Reservations that include children have a lower risk.
> 3. Users who made a change in their reservation have a lower risk.
> 4. When the user has made a special request, the risk is lower.
> 5. Reservations with a low "adr" have a lower risk.

    Conduct a descriptive analysis using the historical data of a hotel chain
    
>For the development of this project, important tools for data analysis will be used. One of them is BigQuery, a database engine created by Google, that allows to efficiently manipulate data through the SQL language. The second is PowerBI, a data visualization tool created by Microsoft.
